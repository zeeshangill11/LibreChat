# About this Fork

This fork is a personal project to add a few features to LibreChat and integrate features from other forks.

## Branches
`jm-productuion` - The main branch for this fork for production use. Stable-ish, but has been at least minimally tested.
`main` - A clone of the upstream main branch.
`new/feature/X` - Branches for new features, kept open until they are feature complete and merged.

## Known Changes from danny-avila/LibreChat
- E2B.dev code interpreter added to the tools list
- Web Navigator plugin added to the tools list.
- Flux AI plugin added to the tools list.
- OpenWeather plugin added to the tools list.

### Why E2B?
LibreChat recently introduced their own code interpreter service. It's affordable, integrates seamlessly with their platform, and provides a viable revenue stream. So why not use it?

For our internal needs, however, we require a code interpreter with network accessâ€”a feature not offered by LibreChat's interpreter for safety reasons. E2B.dev provides an excellent alternative that meets our specific requirements.

***WE STILL LOVE LIBRECHAT!*** In fact, we're proud to be monthly sponsors. Our choice to use E2B.dev is not about detracting from LibreChat's service; we simply need additional functionality to fulfill our unique needs.
